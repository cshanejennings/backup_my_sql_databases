##Personal project

Making this for myself to help automate local database backups after a recent crash.  I'm triggering "multi" with a config file through windows task schedule as I had trouble getting the  parameters to pass through successfully when launching via task scheduler.  (though gitbash and powershell worked with the params without an issue.)

## If I make an update I will add implementation instructions
Let me know if there's anyone interested, but I don't want to spend time on documentation if I end up being the only consumer.
